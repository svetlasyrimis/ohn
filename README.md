### Project Overview:

A web app that connects users with a common passion or interest and facilitate their collaboration on a project of their choice.

### Pre-face: 
Not too long ago, it occurred to me that many people underestimate their competency to create and develop their skills mainly because of their network and lack of time. However, I belive that we are all born with innate desire to create and the most important thing modern people should do is meet people with similar dreams and passions. We need an environment where we can organize thoughts, learn from each other and ultimately as consumers, we want to participate in product development and enjoy the fruits of our labor.


### Project Description:

DreamMaker is a crowdsourcing, multidisciplinary app that connects individuals with free time and passion to create new tangible products. The basis for the idea comes from the belief that people with different skills, but with similar interests and hobbies, can collaborate towards a common goal of ultimately creating a product of their choice. The user, whose role can be an inventor or either worker, can choose to participate in othersâ€™ projects or create a project of his/her own which others can join and complete tasks.
